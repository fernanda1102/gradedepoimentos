            <h2 id="title_first_white_1">Verified Graduate</h2>

            <strong></strong><h3 id="title_second_white_1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
              in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h3></strong>

            <p id="text_white_1">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
              for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
              the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

          for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

        <strong><h3 id="title_second_gray_1">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3></strong>

        <p id="text_gray_1">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
        100% recommend! ”</p>
